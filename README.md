# BHS Intro to Programming

This is your repo where you will keep the code you write in this course.

Initially you won't have to interact directly with git as the tools at
https://intro.gigamonkeys.com/ will commit code to this repo for you
automatically. (I will explain to you how to use this repo to submit
your assignments in the form of "Pull requests".)

Later in the year we will work more directly with git and GitHub.

This repo is yours (i.e. each student has their own) however the tools
I built do need it to be structured in a particular way. For now, please 
do not rename or restructure things, even if you are already familiar
with git or GitHub. Later on, as we get a bit further into using git, 
we may loosen that up a bit.
